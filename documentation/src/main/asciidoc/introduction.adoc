== Introduction

The Spare Part Catalogue App is an abas App by the abas Essentials SDK team to demonstrate the usage of ESDK for abas App development.

It consists of an Infosystem `REPLACEMENTCATALOGUE`, an additonal variable table `Replacement`, a custom database screen for
the `Replacement` database, an enumeration `SPARE_FILE_FORMAT` and a file `test.csv`.

The Spare Part Catalogue App can display replacement catalogues provided in CSV format in the Infosystem `REPLACEMENTCATALOGUE`.
It can also import replacement parts in into the additional database `Replacement`.
